Example set-up of a system of 2 chitosan chains and 100 amyloid-beta peptides at pH 7.5

Generated by following instructions in ~/README.md with the following modifications:

Part VI: Equilibration, Step 3.
    > mpirun ~/programs/bin/gmx_mpi mdrun -s  eq/eq.tpr -deffnm eq/eq -v -nsteps 100
    
    Reason: Simulations was only performed for 100 steps to ensure that commands were working.
    Ideally, this step should be performed on a high performance computing cluster.

Part VII: Production MD, Step 3
    > mpirun ~/programs/bin/gmx_mpi mdrun -s  md/md.tpr -deffnm md/md -v -nsteps 100
    
    Reason: Simulations was only performed for 100 steps to ensure that commands were working.
    Ideally, this step should be performed on a high performance computing cluster.
